NOTE 1 [file T300/adp.mdp]:
  The group cutoff scheme is deprecated since GROMACS 5.0 and will be
  removed in a future release when all interaction forms are supported for
  the verlet scheme. The verlet scheme already scales better, and it is
  compatible with GPUs and other accelerators.

speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
Compiled SIMD: None, but for this host/run AVX_512 might be better (see log).
